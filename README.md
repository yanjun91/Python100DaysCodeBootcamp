- f string format able to auto cast various data types into string (eg.: `print(f"Your score is {score})` where score is a variable in `int` data type)
- Mathematics functions (eg.: `round(2.34567, 2)` become `2.35`, however `round(2.3, 2)` will still be `2.3`)
- Using `{number:.2f}` in f-string to round off and format to 2 decimal places even the number to be round off has lesser decimal places
  - Where:
    - : introduces the format spec
    - 0 enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types
    - .2 sets the precision to 2
    - f displays the number as a fixed-point number

- Exercise 1: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-10-1-exercise
- Calculator project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/calculator-start

### What I learnt:
- Can have multiple return statements in a function but only one that is first processed runs
- Use docstrings to document the function which then will be shown as a description of function when autocomplete
  - To add docstrings, surround the description using `"""` that is typed directly after definition of function, within the function's code block. 
  - `"""` can be used as multiline comments as well but not recommended
- Function can be used as values in dictionary. We can then used it as describe below:

  1. Define a function 
  ```python
  def my_function(x, y):
    return z
  ```
  1. Define dictionary
  ```python
  dict = { 
    "function": my_function 
  }
  ```
  1. Use the function in dictionary 
  ```python
  function = dict["function"]
  function(x, y)
  ```
- Recursion: Calling the a function within the same function

## Day 11

## Day 14
### Replit Links:
- Higher Lower Game Project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/higher-lower-start-1

### What I learnt:
- Breaking down large task into smaller chunks and tackle them one by one

## Day 15
### What I learnt:
- Properly go through requirement before start to code. 

## Day 16
### What I learnt:
- Object Oriented Programming = OOP
- An object has attributes and methods
- Go to pypi.org to see all available modules
- Using prettytable module to pretify table

## Day 17
### What I learnt:
- Use PascalCase for class name and snake_case for variables
- constructor name is `def __init__（self):`
- Try to only accepts input from caller in methods in class instead of doing something like accessing items in list directly

## Day 18
### What I learnt:
- Read documentation to better understand the uses of methods in modules
- Use alias by adding `as` like so, `import turtle as t`
- Tuple is fixed(a.k.a. immutable) and cant be changed while list can. Use `list(my_tuple)` to convert tuple to list

## Day 19
### What I learnt:
- Creating different instances so that each of them are acting independently

## Day 20
### What I learnt:
- using `screen.tracer(0)` together with `screen.update()` and `time.delay(0.1)` to control the refresh rate of the turtle object

## Day 21
### What I learnt:
- Inheritance. Uses code below to inherit Animal class to Fish class, where super refer to the Animal class. We can also override a method from superclass by defining the same method name in subclass.
  ```python
  class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
	  super().__init()
  ```
- Slicing. We can get a subset from a list/tuples and assign to another list. 
  - For example, to get `[c, d, e]` from `alphabets = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]`, we would use `alphabets[2:5]'. 
  - We can also use `alphabets[2:]` to get `[c, d, e, f, g]`
  - Using `alphabets[:5]` results in getting `[a, b, c, d, e]`
  - `alphabets[2:5:2]` will get `[c, e]` while using `alphabets[::2]` would get `[a, c, e, g]`.
  - Use `alphabets[::-1]` to reverse the list
  
## Day 22
### What I learnt:
- Using `onkeypress()` to continuously move the turtle on holding down a key 
  
## Day 23
### What I learnt:
- Need to think out of the box in creating solutions

## Day 24
### What I learnt:
- read, write, append files
- absolute file path starts from root that starts with `/`
- relative file path starts with current folder (working directory) that starts with `./` while using `../` is one step up to parent directory
- Use forward slash regardless of Mac or Windows

## Day 25
### What I learnt:
- using pandas as a way to go through data structures easily and read/write files
- can add image to turtle window as background but only accepts gif type image

## Day 26
### What I learnt:
- List comprehension can be used in the format of `new_list = [new_item for item in list]`
- Conditional list comprehension can be used in the format of `new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]`
- Dictionary comprehension can be used in the format of `new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.items()}`
- Conditional dictionary comprehension can be used in the format of `new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.items() if test}`
- loop through data frame using comprehension: `{new_key:new_value for (index, row) in df.iterrows()}`

## Day 27
### What I learnt:
- Using tkinter module to build a GUI 
- we can put default value to parameters of function when defining it which renders them optionals
  - `def my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3):` then we can call without pass in any arguments 
- we can add unlimited number of arguments by using `*args` as parameter like below
  ```python
  def add(*args):
    total = 0
    for n in args:
        total += n
    return total
  ```
- use `**kwargs` as parameter in a function definition as keyword arguments where arguments are in key-value pair
  ```python
  def calculate(n, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    n += kwargs["add"]
    n *= kwargs["multiply"]
    print(n)

  calculate(2, add=3, multiply=5)
  ```
- We can define our own class constructor with `**kw`. 
  ```python
  class Car:
    def __init__(self, **kw):
        # self.make = kw["make"]
        # self.model = kw["model"]
        # Using .get() so that it just return None instead of error if the specific argument not specified when call
        self.make = kw.get("make")
        self.model = kw.get("model")
  
  my_car = Car(make="Nissan")
  print(my_car.make)
  ```
- the parameter name `args` and `kwargs` in `*args` and `**kwargs` respectively can change to other name. The number of asterisk is the one that determine whether it is a unlimited arguments or keyword argument

## Day 28
### What I learnt:
- Adding image using canvas
- using `windows.after(1000, some_function, x)` to call `some_function` function with `x` as argument after 1 second
- dynamic typing concept in python means we can change the type of a variable when we change it, say, from `int` to `str` and it still work
  ```python
  a = 4  # int type
  a = "Hi"  # str type
  # a changes from int type to str type
  ```

## Day 29
### What I learnt:
- `Entry.delete(0, END)` will clear the entry of string from index 0 to end of string
- The code below will yield an input entry of "123yanjun@email.com". The first parameter indicates the index to insert the text. Using `END` will insert to the end of string.
   ```python
   email_entry.insert(0, "yanjun@email.com")
   email_entry.insert(0, "123")
   ```

## Day 30
### What I learnt:
- catch exception syntax format:
```python
  try:
    # your own logic that might cause exception
  except:
    # execute logic here if there was an exception
  else:
    # execute logic here if no exception
  finally:
    # no matter what happen, execute logic here
```
- we can raise exception by using `raise`. For example: `raise TypeError("This is an error that I made up.")` which includes our own message
- Json functions
  - Write: `json.dump()`, it will convert into json format as well
  - Read: `json.load()`, which will serialized into dict type
  - Update: `json.update()`

## Day 31
### What I learnt:
- updating text, image in canvas
- more understanding on using `window.after()`

## Day 32
### What I learnt:
- Sending email using Python through SMTP
- Use `msg="Subject:Hello\n\nThis is the body of my email"` as the `sendmail()` parameter to specify the email subject "Hello" and email body by adding `\n\n`
- Use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host python code in the cloud

## Day 33
### What I learnt:
- Use `requests` module to call API
- Response codes meaning in plain text: 
  - 1XX: Hold On
  - 2XX: Here You Go
  - 3XX: Go Away
  - 4XX: You Screwed Up
  - 5XX: I Screwed Up
- HTTP Status reference: [https://httpstatuses.com/](https://httpstatuses.com/)

## Day 34
### What I learnt:
- We can define data type for the variables/parameter upfront using format `variable: data_type`. For example, `age: int`. In class or function, we just put it in parentheses when defining it
- We can also define the return type of function using `-> data_type` format. For example, `def check_price(price: int) -> bool:` would return a bool type

## Day 35
