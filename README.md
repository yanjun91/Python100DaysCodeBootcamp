- simple debugging
- NameError exception

## Day 2
### Replit Links:
- start: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-2-start
- Exercise 1: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-2-1-exercise
- Exercise 2: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-2-2-exercise
- Exercise 3: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-2-3-exercise
- Project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/tip-calculator-start
### What I learnt:
- Use `**` as exponential
- Use `type()` to check data type
- Type casting (eg.: `str()`, `int()`, `float()`)
- TypeError exception
- Using floor division `//` to calculate floor value in `int` type (eg.: `8 // 3` output is 2 instead of 2.666..)
- Shorthand operators (eg.: `x += 1` equals to `x = x + 1`)
- f string format able to auto cast various data types into string (eg.: `print(f"Your score is {score})` where score is a variable in `int` data type)
- Mathematics functions (eg.: `round(2.34567, 2)` become `2.35`, however `round(2.3, 2)` will still be `2.3`)
- Using `{number:.2f}` in f-string to round off and format to 2 decimal places even the number to be round off has lesser decimal places
  - Where:
    - : introduces the format spec
    - 0 enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types
    - .2 sets the precision to 2
    - f displays the number as a fixed-point number
