### What I learnt:
- Use `**` as exponential
- Use `type()` to check data type
- Type casting (eg.: `str()`, `int()`, `float()`)
- TypeError exception
- Using floor division `//` to calculate floor value in `int` type (eg.: `8 // 3` output is 2 instead of 2.666..)
- Shorthand operators (eg.: `x += 1` equals to `x = x + 1`)
- f string format able to auto cast various data types into string (eg.: `print(f"Your score is {score})` where score is a variable in `int` data type)
- Mathematics functions (eg.: `round(2.34567, 2)` become `2.35`, however `round(2.3, 2)` will still be `2.3`)
- Using `{number:.2f}` in f-string to round off and format to 2 decimal places even the number to be round off has lesser decimal places
  - Where:
    - : introduces the format spec
    - 0 enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types
    - .2 sets the precision to 2
    - f displays the number as a fixed-point number

  - argument is the value passed in when calling function (i.e.: `greet("Yan Jun")` where "Yan Jun" is the argument)
- Positional argument is argument that we passed into function in the order
- Keyword argument is used to specified which parameter that the argument should assigned to
- Using modulus to loop within the length of list to ensure index wont go out of bound

- Blind Auction Project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/blind-auction-start

### What I learnt:
- Dictionary is a list of key-value pairs where the key can be of any primitive type like string or int 
- Nesting of dictionaries and/or lists within another dictionary/list
- Using for loop on dictionary yields key instead of its value

## Day 10
### Replit Links:
- start: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-10-start
- Exercise 1: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-10-1-exercise
- Calculator project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/calculator-start

### What I learnt:
- Can have multiple return statements in a function but only one that is first processed runs
- Use docstrings to document the function which then will be shown as a description of function when autocomplete
  - To add docstrings, surround the description using `"""` that is typed directly after definition of function, within the function's code block. 
  - `"""` can be used as multiline comments as well but not recommended
- Function can be used as values in dictionary. We can then used it as describe below:

  1. Define a function 
  ```python
  def my_function(x, y):<br>
    return z
  ```
  1. Define dictionary
  ```python
  dict = { 
    "function": my_function 
  }
  ```
  1. Use the function in dictionary 
  ```python
  function = dict["function"]
  function(x, y)
  ```
- Recursion: Calling the a function within the same function

## Day 11
### Replit Links:

- Exercise 2: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-13-2-exercise
- Exercise 3: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/day-13-3-exercise

### What I learnt:
- Use print or debugger to debug your code

## Day 14
### Replit Links:
- Higher Lower Game Project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/higher-lower-start-1

### What I learnt:
- Breaking down large task into smaller chunks and tackle them one by one

## Day 15
### What I learnt:
- Properly go through requirement before start to code. 

## Day 16
### What I learnt:
- Object Oriented Programming = OOP
- An object has attributes and methods
- Go to pypi.org to see all available modules
- Using prettytable module to pretify table

## Day 17
### What I learnt:
- Use PascalCase for class name and snake_case for variables
- constructor name is `def __init__（self):`
- Try to only accepts input from caller in methods in class instead of doing something like accessing items in list directly

## Day 18
### What I learnt:
- Read documentation to better understand the uses of methods in modules
- Use alias by adding `as` like so, `import turtle as t`
- Tuple is fixed(a.k.a. immutable) and cant be changed while list can. Use `list(my_tuple)` to convert tuple to list

## Day 19
### What I learnt:
- Creating different instances so that each of them are acting independently

## Day 20
### What I learnt:
- using `screen.tracer(0)` together with `screen.update()` and `time.delay(0.1)` to control the refresh rate of the turtle object

## Day 21
### What I learnt:
- Inheritance. Uses code below to inherit Animal class to Fish class, where super refer to the Animal class. We can also override a method from superclass by defining the same method name in subclass.
  ```python
  class Fish(Animal):<br>
    def __init__(self):
	  super().__init()
  ```
- Slicing. We can get a subset from a list/tuples and assign to another list. 
  - For example, to get `[c, d, e]` from `alphabets = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]`, we would use `alphabets[2:5]'. 
  - We can also use `alphabets[2:]` to get `[c, d, e, f, g]`
  - Using `alphabets[:5]` results in getting `[a, b, c, d, e]`
  - `alphabets[2:5:2]` will get `[c, e]` while using `alphabets[::2]` would get `[a, c, e, g]`.
  - Use `alphabets[::-1]` to reverse the list
  
## Day 22
### What I learnt:
- Using `onkeypress()` to continuously move the turtle on holding down a key 
  
## Day 23
### What I learnt:
- Need to think out of the box in creating solutions
