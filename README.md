### What I learnt:
- Can have multiple return statements in a function but only one that is first processed runs
- Use docstrings to document the function which then will be shown as a description of function when autocomplete
  - To add docstrings, surround the description using `"""` that is typed directly after definition of function, within the function's code block. 
  - `"""` can be used as multiline comments as well but not recommended
- Function can be used as values in dictionary. We can then used it as describe below:

  1. Define a function 
  ```python
  def my_function(x, y):
    return z
  ```
  1. Define dictionary
  ```python
  dict = { 
    "function": my_function 
  }
  ```
  1. Use the function in dictionary 
  ```python
  function = dict["function"]
  function(x, y)
  ```
- Recursion: Calling the a function within the same function

## Day 11

## Day 14
### Replit Links:
- Higher Lower Game Project: https://replit.com/@yanjun91/higher-lower-start-1

### What I learnt:
- Breaking down large task into smaller chunks and tackle them one by one

## Day 15
### What I learnt:
- Properly go through requirement before start to code. 

## Day 16
### What I learnt:
- Object Oriented Programming = OOP
- An object has attributes and methods
- Go to pypi.org to see all available modules
- Using prettytable module to pretify table

## Day 17
### What I learnt:
- Use PascalCase for class name and snake_case for variables
- constructor name is `def __init__（self):`
- Try to only accepts input from caller in methods in class instead of doing something like accessing items in list directly

## Day 18
### What I learnt:
- Read documentation to better understand the uses of methods in modules
- Use alias by adding `as` like so, `import turtle as t`
- Tuple is fixed(a.k.a. immutable) and cant be changed while list can. Use `list(my_tuple)` to convert tuple to list

## Day 19
### What I learnt:
- Creating different instances so that each of them are acting independently

## Day 20
### What I learnt:
- using `screen.tracer(0)` together with `screen.update()` and `time.delay(0.1)` to control the refresh rate of the turtle object

## Day 21
### What I learnt:
- Inheritance. Uses code below to inherit Animal class to Fish class, where super refer to the Animal class. We can also override a method from superclass by defining the same method name in subclass.
  ```python
  class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
	  super().__init()
  ```
- Slicing. We can get a subset from a list/tuples and assign to another list. 
  - For example, to get `[c, d, e]` from `alphabets = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]`, we would use `alphabets[2:5]'. 
  - We can also use `alphabets[2:]` to get `[c, d, e, f, g]`
  - Using `alphabets[:5]` results in getting `[a, b, c, d, e]`
  - `alphabets[2:5:2]` will get `[c, e]` while using `alphabets[::2]` would get `[a, c, e, g]`.
  - Use `alphabets[::-1]` to reverse the list
  
## Day 22
### What I learnt:
- Using `onkeypress()` to continuously move the turtle on holding down a key 
  
## Day 23
### What I learnt:
- Need to think out of the box in creating solutions

## Day 24
### What I learnt:
- read, write, append files
- absolute file path starts from root that starts with `/`
- relative file path starts with current folder (working directory) that starts with `./` while using `../` is one step up to parent directory
- Use forward slash regardless of Mac or Windows

## Day 25
### What I learnt:
- using pandas as a way to go through data structures easily and read/write files
- can add image to turtle window as background but only accepts gif type image

## Day 26
### What I learnt:
- List comprehension can be used in the format of `new_list = [new_item for item in list]`
- Conditional list comprehension can be used in the format of `new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]`
- Dictionary comprehension can be used in the format of `new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.items()}`
- Conditional dictionary comprehension can be used in the format of `new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.items() if test}`
- loop through data frame using comprehension: `{new_key:new_value for (index, row) in df.iterrows()}`

## Day 27
### What I learnt:
- Using tkinter module to build a GUI 
- we can put default value to parameters of function when defining it which renders them optionals
  - `def my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3):` then we can call without pass in any arguments 
- we can add unlimited number of arguments by using `*args` as parameter like below
  ```python
  def add(*args):
    total = 0
    for n in args:
        total += n
    return total
  ```
- use `**kwargs` as parameter in a function definition as keyword arguments where arguments are in key-value pair
  ```python
  def calculate(n, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    n += kwargs["add"]
    n *= kwargs["multiply"]
    print(n)

  calculate(2, add=3, multiply=5)
  ```
- We can define our own class constructor with `**kw`. 
  ```python
  class Car:
    def __init__(self, **kw):
        # self.make = kw["make"]
        # self.model = kw["model"]
        # Using .get() so that it just return None instead of error if the specific argument not specified when call
        self.make = kw.get("make")
        self.model = kw.get("model")
  
  my_car = Car(make="Nissan")
  print(my_car.make)
  ```
- the parameter name `args` and `kwargs` in `*args` and `**kwargs` respectively can change to other name. The number of asterisk is the one that determine whether it is a unlimited arguments or keyword argument

## Day 28
### What I learnt:
- Adding image using canvas
- using `windows.after(1000, some_function, x)` to call `some_function` function with `x` as argument after 1 second
- dynamic typing concept in python means we can change the type of a variable when we change it, say, from `int` to `str` and it still work
  ```python
  a = 4  # int type
  a = "Hi"  # str type
  # a changes from int type to str type
  ```

## Day 29
### What I learnt:
- `Entry.delete(0, END)` will clear the entry of string from index 0 to end of string
- The code below will yield an input entry of "123yanjun@email.com". The first parameter indicates the index to insert the text. Using `END` will insert to the end of string.
   ```python
   email_entry.insert(0, "yanjun@email.com")
   email_entry.insert(0, "123")
   ```

## Day 30
### What I learnt:
- catch exception syntax format:
```python
  try:
    # your own logic that might cause exception
  except:
    # execute logic here if there was an exception
  else:
    # execute logic here if no exception
  finally:
    # no matter what happen, execute logic here
```
- we can raise exception by using `raise`. For example: `raise TypeError("This is an error that I made up.")` which includes our own message
- Json functions
  - Write: `json.dump()`, it will convert into json format as well
  - Read: `json.load()`, which will serialized into dict type
  - Update: `json.update()`

## Day 31
### What I learnt:
- updating text, image in canvas
- more understanding on using `window.after()`

## Day 32
### What I learnt:
- Sending email using Python through SMTP
- Use `msg="Subject:Hello\n\nThis is the body of my email"` as the `sendmail()` parameter to specify the email subject "Hello" and email body by adding `\n\n`
- Use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host python code in the cloud

## Day 33
### What I learnt:
- Use `requests` module to call API
- Response codes meaning in plain text: 
  - 1XX: Hold On
  - 2XX: Here You Go
  - 3XX: Go Away
  - 4XX: You Screwed Up
  - 5XX: I Screwed Up
- HTTP Status reference: [https://httpstatuses.com/](https://httpstatuses.com/)

## Day 34
### What I learnt:
- We can define data type for the variables/parameter upfront using format `variable: data_type`. For example, `age: int`. In class or function, we just put it in parentheses when defining it
- We can also define the return type of function using `-> data_type` format. For example, `def check_price(price: int) -> bool:` would return a bool type

## Day 35

  - GET: requests.get() => get data from API
  - POST: requests.post() => give data to API
  - PUT: requests.put() => update data through API
  - DELETE: requests.delete() => delete data through API
- Using [pixela](https://pixe.la/) to track habits through their APIs

## Day 38
### What I learnt:
- Combined knowledge learnt in previous lessons.

## Day 39 & 40
### What I learnt:
- Go through API documentation for info on how to use the API

## Day 41
### What I learnt:
- How Internet works
- Basic elements of HTML tags

## Day 42
### What I learnt:
- Tables, Forms elements
- Can host a website free in github
  1. Create a repository
  2. Upload html files
  3. Go to Settings > Github Pages section
  4. At Source, choose master branch from the dropdown and click Save.
  5. It may take some time to publish the website. The link to the website will be shown at the Github Pages section.

## Day 43
### What I learnt:
- Using inline, internal and external CSS to style HTML pages.
- Different way to style elements in HTML pages by using tags/class/id selectors.

## Day 44
### What I learnt:
- Box model of div tag
- display block elements takes up the whole width of the page regardless of content, but height still determine by content. However, we can change the width of them using CSS.
  - Common block elements: `<p>`, `<h1>...<h6>`, `<div>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` and `<form>`
- display inline elements does not take up whole width of page but just the size that it needs only.
  - Common inline elements: `<span>`, `<img>` and `<a>`
- inline-block is hybrid of both block and inline. We can change it's width and can put inline with several elements.
- static position is the original position that those elements would be without any css.
- relative position is the position moved from the original static position(aka relative to the original static position). We would generally use relative position with some positioning css property. The element with relative position will not affect other element so it might overlap other element if we move it.
- Example below shows the img element move 30px to the right from it's original static position:
```css
img {
	position: relative;
	left: 30px;
}
```
- abosulte position will move its position relative to its parent element. This will affect flow of other elements.
- fixed position will stick to a position relative to its parents even when we scroll the page.
- text-align used in a parent element will center everything for its child elements. Use `margin: 0 auto` to center if block display element has some width.
- 100% or 1em font-size is equivalent to 16px. Recommend to use 1**r**em so that in case parent element as font size set to 2em or more then it wont stack.
- Google font css link import: https://fonts.google.com/

- Basic unix commands
  - Use `rm -rf <FolderName>`: -rf means recursively forcibly. All files and directory inside that folder will be removed.
- `__name__` will have the current class/function/method/descriptor/generator name
  - If we run that specific Python file, then the `__name__` will be `__main__`
-@app.route('/') is a decorator function. Whatever function definition under it will be triggered with additional functionalities defined in app.route. 

## Day 55
### What I learnt:
- Run in debug mode by adding `debug=True` in `app.run()` like so, `app.run(debug=True)`
- We can specify the path variable to certain data types like int. If that particular variable is of a different type, say string, then it will render as 404 not found.

## Day 56
### What I learnt:

## Day 57
### What I learnt:
- Use Jinja to template webpage content dynamically
- Use `{{ <Python Code> }}` in html file to render python codes
- pass in dynamic content using **kwargs in `render_template()` as parameter. `render_template("index.html", key=value)`
- use {% %} for multiline python code in html file and add {% endfor %} or {% endif %} depending on the code.
- use `{{ url_for('<function_name>') }}` in html file inside href to navigate to the page
  - we can even add parameters to the `use_for()` method to pass in the params for the URL. For example, if we are to add num as part of the url as params then use this: `{{ url_for('<function_name>', num = 3) }}`
  
## Day 58
### What I learnt:
- Using Bootstrap to style web page.
- z-index only takes effect when we use position property
- Hierarchy of applying css styles from most important to least important: inline css > internal css > id > class > elements
- try not to use id unless necessary even if the element only appear once. Use id on sections only.
- bad practice to use inline css style

- Use analogous color (colors besides each other in color palette wheel) works well together. Good for navigation bar and body of website, logo and its background. Not good for standing out.
- Use complementary color (colors opposite each other in color palette wheel) to makes something pop but do not use them as your font color and background color.
- Use sans-serif and serif in title and body in turn. Use Humanist typeface for easier reading.
